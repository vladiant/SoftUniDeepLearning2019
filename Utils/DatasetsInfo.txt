Dataset 1
http://artelab.dista.uninsubria.it/downloads/datasets/barcode/medium_barcode_1d/medium_barcode_1d.html

    Images are grouped into two sub-datasets:
        dataset no.1 contains pictures of barcodes taken from devices with autofocus.
        dataset no.2 contains pictures taken by devices without autofocus.
    If you use this dataset in your work, please add the following reference:
        Neural Image Restoration For Decoding 1-D Barcodes Using Common Camera Phones
        Alessandro Zamberletti, Ignazio Gallo, Moreno Carullo and Elisabetta Binaghi

Dataset 2
http://artelab.dista.uninsubria.it/downloads/datasets/barcode/medium_barcode_1d_train/medium_barcode_1d_train.html

    Each folder contains a pair of input/output images.
    Input images are blurred and noisy
    Output images are clean versions of their respective input images.
    All the pairs have been used to train a neural model for the restoration of images containing blurred 1D barcodes.

Dataset 4
http://artelab.dista.uninsubria.it/downloads/datasets/barcode/hough_barcode_1d/hough_barcode_1d.html

    The 3 datasets used to train and evaluate our Hough transform based barcode detection algorithms are available for download:
        dataset no.1 (1d_barcode_hough.zip) contains the samples used to train the MLP model to detect barcodes in the Hough transform space.
        dataset no.2 (1d_barcode_extended.zip) contains the samples used to evaluate our detection algorithm.
        dataset no.2 plain (1d_barcode_extended_plain.zip) contains only the images and the detection masks
        dataset no.3 (muenster barcodeDB_detection_masks.zip) contains the detection masks for the images in the WWU Muenster Barcode Database of Wachenfeld, Terlunen and Jiang [homepage].

Context:

“The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode symbology that is widely used in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, in Europe and other countries for tracking trade items in stores.

“UPC (technically refers to UPC-A) consists of 12 numeric digits, that are uniquely assigned to each trade item. Along with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale, per GS1 specifications.[1] UPC data structures are a component of GTINs and follow the global GS1 specification, which is based on international standards. But some retailers (clothing, furniture) do not use the GS1 system (rather other barcode symbologies or article number systems). On the other hand, some retailers use the EAN/UPC barcode symbology, but without using a GTIN (for products, brands, sold at such retailers only).”
